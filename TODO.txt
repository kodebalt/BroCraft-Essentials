Minor -
   DONE * ALL CONFIGS: Reformat like vanilla tweaks to be proper width
   * ALL: Add reset all config button
   * ALL: Namespace #vars with pack name
   DONE * AFKSmart: Make You are <gold>now</gold> AFK, You are <gold>no longer</gold> AFK in order to be consistent with other BCE packs
   DONE * AFKSmart: output time to afk after changing config
   * AFKSmart: Implement smart valid/invalid config checker like in playerteams
   * AFKSmart: BUG - if player joins another team besides afk while afk, it resets afk status. add score like shouldBeAFK to keep in team
   DONE * PlayerTeams: BUG - playerteams.currentTeam is reset when disabled. why? found: cause NOT_AFK team is removed 1 tick after loading. fix: schedule rejointeam function to be 1t after load. ez
   DONE * PlayerTeams: Multi page config
   DONE * PlayerTeams: trigger output capitalize
   DONE * PlayerTeams: team control panel for picking team to join on player trigger. maybe /trigger joinateam
   DONE * PlayerTeams: output default color code after changing config and output actual color?
   DONE * PlayerTeams: change team color in hover window
   * PlayerTeams: joinateam control panel - disable current team (lots of checking, but we making this look good. hopefully this doesnt kill performance doing all this)
   * PlayerTeams: config panel for players current team to modify prefix
   * PlayerTeams: add admin config option for max number of players in team
   * PlayerTeams: reset team prefix if max number of players is one and player leaves the team for good (have to handle cases of team change such as going afk)
   * PlayerTeams: BUG - player rejoins team even if afk. fix: add afksmart hook to playerteams? ugh. ooooo what if we check to see if the player is in a non playerteams team and do not modify? wouldnt be smart with other pack compatibility, so a hook is ultimately the best solution, ugh again
   * Playtime: track total AFK time
   * AFKSmart/PlayerTeams: BUG - config option change message on first join. fix: setup init score for new players that runs function to setup those scores and future proof it
   * AFKSmart/PlayerTeams: Rename teams to have some control over sort order
