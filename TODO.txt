1. PlayerTeams: Two page config
2. AFKSmart: output time to afk after changing config
3. PlayerTeams: add button to join team?
4. PlayerTeams: output default color code after changing config
5. PlayerTeams: change team color in hover window

Major 1. AFKSmart: Rewrite movement to be xyz based. Create copy first to test efficiency

BIG IDEA: Create helper pack that watches all created BCE datapacks for disabling 
	uninstall most things
	smart team control (if disable afk, player shouldnt be in afk team, could handle by just delete teams)
